#Brand Redesign

For this assignment, you need to create your own version of brand or company's website. Here is a list of all Fortune 500 companies and their websites (Links to an external site.) to use for inspiration, but the brand/company you choose does not have to be from this list. 

Your goal is to create a high quality, professional design that is good enough to replace the existing site, if not better.

You do not need to create multiple pages, just the main page is sufficient, and your links don't have to go anywhere, or can go to the real sites they're linking to.

Make sure you consider the audiences for the website and have appropriate calls to action to give the users an action they can take in response to your content.

Requirements:

Very clear primary and secondary audience (consumers, investors, job applicants, etc.) with navigation and content tailored to each. Calls to action along with all content (where it makes sense).
Use design principles learned in class to create visual hierarchy, consistent structure, and pleasing aesthetics. Your site will be judged on how good it looks!
Excellent grammar used, well-written content (even if copied from existing site).
Relevant information displayed in an appropriate layout.
Should have a variety of relevant content- paragraphs (about the company, information for buyers, mission statement, etc.), lists (upcoming events, job application requirements, board members, etc), and tables (hours of operation, locations, etc).
Navigation is clear and easy to use.
Very clean, professional design with at least 4 high quality, well-placed images. Design good enough to replace existing site, if not better.
Mobile friendly! Your design must have at least one "breakpoint" where the layout changes in some way to accommodate mobile devices. Make sure the site looks good on smaller screens, points will be deducted if not!
